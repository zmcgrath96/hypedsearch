def read(filename: str, peak_filter=0, relative_abundance_filter=0) -> list:
    '''
    read an .mzML file into memory. Filter out the peaks by the type specified.
    If both filter types are set to 0, all peaks are returned, otherwise filtering 
    will happen. If both filters are given a value, peak_filter is given preference.

    Inputs:
        filename:       (str) path to the file to import
    kwargs:
        peak_filter:                (int) the top number of peaks to keep. Default=0
        relative_abundance_filter:  (float) thee percentage of abundance a peak must have to be
                                    considered. Must be in range(0, 1) or the integer is converted
                                    to a decimal in that range. Default=0
    Outputs:
        (list) Spectrum namedtuple instances
